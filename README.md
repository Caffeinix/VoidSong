# Void Song

Void Song is a tactical space simulator featuring physically believable real-time capital ship 
combat. Ships in Void Song are equipped with FTL jump drives, but are otherwise subject to all the 
usual laws of physics â€” most notably light lag. Unlike other space combat games where 
maneuverability, accuracy, and other dogfighting skills are prioritized, combat in Void Song 
requires you to understand the nature of strategic and tactical information and how it propagates 
through space.

The code you see here is a single-player, 2D proof-of-concept demo, but is intended to be playable.
